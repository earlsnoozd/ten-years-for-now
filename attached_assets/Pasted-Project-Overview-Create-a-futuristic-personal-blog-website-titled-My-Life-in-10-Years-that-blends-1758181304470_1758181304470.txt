Project Overview:
Create a futuristic personal blog website titled “My Life in 10 Years” that blends minimalism, boldness, and cosmic-inspired AI visuals. Instead of stars, the background should feature animated neural network patterns that feel alive, dynamic, and slightly abstract, giving a “living AI universe” vibe.

Theme & Aesthetic:

Dark galaxy-inspired background (#0a0a1a to #1a1a3a gradient).

Text contrast: white for headlines, light gray (#d0d0d0) for content.

Apple’s minimalism (clean spacing, elegant typography).

Tesla’s boldness (strong contrasts, sleek edges).

Starlink cosmic inspiration → Neural Network twist: interconnected nodes and lines glowing like synapses across the background.

Subtle neon accents (#00ffff, #6a5acd, #ff69b4) for nodes, connections, and hover effects.

Layout & Features:

Hero Section:

Full-screen neural network animation in the background.

Centered headline: “My Life in 10 Years”

Inspiring tagline underneath, fading in smoothly.

Scroll-Based Sections:

Career Vision

Lifestyle & Growth

Impact & Legacy

Closing Note

Each section: parallax effects, text fade-ins, and neural network subtly animating behind or around content.

Navigation:

Minimal sticky top navigation with section links.

Fades during scroll. Smooth scroll effect when clicked.

Animations & Interactivity:

Fade-in text and images on scroll.

Parallax movement of neural network nodes (slow, subtle).

Hover effects: glowing nodes or lines for interactive elements.

Responsiveness:

Fully responsive design for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Neural network background scales and animates appropriately on smaller screens.

Optional Enhancements:

Dynamic node activity: nodes light up as user scrolls or hovers.

Subtle pulsing lines connecting nodes to simulate neural signals.

Occasional “spark” animations across connections to add life.

Goal:
Deliver a futuristic, minimal, AI-inspired personal vision website where neural networks replace stars, creating an immersive, living, and aspirational experience that reflects your career and life vision.
